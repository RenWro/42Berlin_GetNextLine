The purpose of this project is to read a line on a fd. This task is crucial to understand for a programmer since much of the time is based on manipulating files for data management and persistence. This project consists of coding a function that returns one line at a time from a text file.

Using The Program

Compile the program:

    cc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -g get_next_line.c get_next_line_utils.c main.c

Or compile the bonus:

    cc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -g get_next_line_bonus.c get_next_line_utils_bonus.c main.c


To run the program:

    ./a.out text1.txt

or
    
    ./a.out text2.txt


What is Valgrind?

Valgrind is a powerful debugging and profiling tool primarily used for memory-related issues in programs written in C and C++. It helps developers detect:

    Memory Leaks: Memory that is allocated but never freed.
    Invalid Memory Access: Accessing memory that was already freed or not allocated.
    Uninitialized Variable Use: Using variables that were not properly initialized.
    Thread and Concurrency Issues: Detecting race conditions in multithreaded programs.

It is particularly useful in ensuring your program adheres to good memory management practices and prevents crashes.

To use it, the following code is useful:

    cc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -g get_next_line.c get_next_line_utils.c main.c

Followed by

    valgrind --leak-check=full ./a.out text1.txt

or

    valgrind --leak-check=full --track-origins=yes ./a.out text1.txt text2.txt


Testing with Multiple File Descriptors (Bonus)

One of the main features of the bonus is support for multiple file descriptors. You can test this functionality by modifying your main_bonus.c to open more than one file simultaneously. Example:

Compliling and executing:

        cc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -g get_next_line_bonus.c get_next_line_utils_bonus.c main_bonus.c 

        ./a.out

<h1>About it all</h1>

What is BUFFER_SIZE?

The BUFFER_SIZE defines the number of bytes that will be read from the file (or file descriptor) in each call to the read() function. It directly influences:

    The number of system calls (read()) performed.
    The size of the temporary memory allocated for each read operation.

Stack Compatibility:

A smaller BUFFER_SIZE reduces the risk of memory overflow on the stack (especially on systems with limited memory), as larger buffers occupy more temporary space.


Static Buffer as a memory keeper

In this get_next_line function, we use a static variable like this

char *get_next_line(int fd)
{
    static char *buffer;
    // ... rest of the function
}

This buffer isn't just any ordinary variable. Let's break it down:

    Persistent Memory: Unlike regular variables that forget everything when the function ends, our static buffer remembers its contents between function calls. It's like having a notepad that doesn't get erased when you close the book!

    Picking Up Where We Left Off: Thanks to this memory, we can continue reading from exactly where we stopped last time. No need to start from the beginning of the file each time get_next_line is called.

    Handling Partial Reads: Sometimes, we might read more than one line into our buffer. The static variable allows us to keep that extra data for the next function call, ensuring we don't lose any information.

Why do we use keep[1024]?

    Management of Multiple File Descriptors (FDs):
        keep[1024] is a static array of pointers, where each index stores the unprocessed data associated with a specific FD.
        Each FD is independent, ensuring that reading from one file does not interfere with others.

    File Descriptor Limitations:
        The operating system generally limits the maximum number of file descriptors a process can open. On UNIX systems, the default is 1024, but this can be configured. Therefore, keep[1024] is sufficient for most cases.

Why not use BUFFER_SIZE = 1024?

    Temporary Memory vs. Static Storage:
        BUFFER_SIZE determines the amount of data read in each read() call. With a BUFFER_SIZE of 1024, the read() function allocates more temporary memory, which can be inefficient for small files.
        In contrast, keep[1024] is static and serves as persistent storage between get_next_line calls.

    Performance with Small Files:
        A smaller BUFFER_SIZE (like 32) reduces memory waste when dealing with small files or short lines. Conversely, BUFFER_SIZE = 1024 might result in reading large blocks of data that won't be immediately used.

    Stack Overhead:
        A larger BUFFER_SIZE consumes more stack space with each call to get_next_line. This can lead to stack overflow issues on systems with limited memory.

<h2>A bit more about File Descriptors</h2>

To put it visually simple, this is what a File Descriptor does:
There are three file descriptors created by default: 0, 1 and 2. 0 corresponds to the “keyboard file” in the kernel and 1 and 2 correspond to the “monitor file”. If we were to sketch all this on paper, it would look a bit like below:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/419b3574-7056-4e7a-b92f-2b8899981efa)

These arrows, call them channels, have a special name: streams. Stream is an abstract name to make it easier for the programmer to visualize what is happening with the data. It’s easier to talk about stream of data than to talk about indices and the file structures in the kernel that those indices correspond to.

Now the three default file descriptors we talked about earlier, have in fact been baptized with their own special names: stdin, stdout and stderr.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/64f7050f-8202-43e8-8850-b843af21986e)

When a new process gets created, file descriptors 0, 1 and 2 are created automatically and mapped to stdin, stdout and stderr.

Just because file descriptors 0, 1, 2 are standard it doesn’t mean that they are always going to correspond to stdin, stdout and stderr. Standard streams are as we think until the programmer decides it’s time to change things around. That is something that will be demonstrated. Bellow you see a visual representation of file descriptors and their connection with the kernel.

 ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/db6cbbe3-c4e6-4e83-adae-7b661bef9737)

This is how the processes look like if we assume that file descriptors are not altered in any way. The arrows show the flow of data. The keyboard and screen icons in the kernel are file structures of the special files. This was just a general intro to understand File Descriptors.



<h2>How It Works in get_next_line</h2>

A typical lifecycle of our static buffer:

    First Call:
        We allocate memory for buffer and read from the file.
        We extract the first line and return it.
        Any leftover data stays in buffer.

    Subsequent Calls:
        buffer still contains the leftover data from last time.
        We start by checking if there's a complete line in buffer.
        If not, we read more from the file and append to buffer.
        We extract the next line and update buffer again.

    Last Call:
        We've reached the end of the file.
        We return any remaining data in buffer.
        We free buffer and set it to NULL.

Why Static?

    Efficiency: We don't need to re-read the entire file for each line. We just continue from where we left off.
    Simplicity: The static variable handles the state management for us. No need to pass around a pointer to keep track of our position.
    Memory Management: We can allocate memory once and reuse it, rather than allocating new memory for each function call.

The Catch

While our static buffer is very useful, it does come with a few quirks:

    ⚠️ Multiple File Descriptors: If you're reading from multiple files, you'll need to handle each file descriptor separately.
    ⚠️ Memory Usage: The buffer sticks around until the program ends, even if you're done reading the file.
    ⚠️ Thread Safety: If you're working in a multi-threaded environment, you'll need extra care to make this thread-safe.

How that works?

    Buffer, Our Old Friend: Just like in our buffer overflow example, get_next_line uses a buffer. But don't worry, it's not trying to overflow anything! This buffer is more like a temporary storage space.
    Reading Chunks: Instead of reading the whole file at once, it reads chunks into the buffer. Think of it like taking bites of a sandwich instead of shoving the whole thing in your mouth.
    Searching for the Newline: After each read, it looks for the \n character. It's like playing "Where's Waldo?", but Waldo is a newline, and the crowd is our buffer full of characters.
    Returning the Line: When it finds a newline (or reaches the end of the file), it says "Aha! Here's a complete line!" and returns it to you.
    Remembering Where It Left Off: Here's where it gets clever. It remembers where it stopped, so the next time you call it, it starts from there. It's like using a bookmark in a really long book.
    
<h2>Why is <fcntl.h> important in get_next_line?</h2>

In the get_next_line project, <fcntl.h> is typically included because it provides file Access Modes: Constants like O_RDONLY (read-only), O_WRONLY (write-only), and O_RDWR (read and write).


How does it work in get_next_line?

In get_next_line, the open() function (declared in <fcntl.h>) is commonly used to open a file and obtain its file descriptor (fd). This fd is then passed to get_next_line() to read the file line by line.

#include <fcntl.h> is essential for:

- Defining constants like O_RDONLY, O_WRONLY, O_CREAT, etc.
- Using system-level file manipulation functions like open().

Without it, your program wouldn’t compile if you’re using open() or similar low-level file operations.
